1) Avoid using wildcard (%) at the beginning of a predicate (in our case: LIKE '%キャビンアテンダント%'), as it causes full table scan and will cause dramatic slow down of the query execution.
The solution is to use MySQL Full-Text Search ability. This will implicate creating full text indexes for the fields involved in the LIKE predicates and replace the LIKE predicates with MySQL Full-Text Search Function MATCH(cols....) AGAINST ('キャビンアテンダント')
This can be achieved by the following queries:*/

/*
More SQL queries optimization Rules:
- Keep the keys consistent in one type of data (foreign keys and there corresponding primary keys should be of same type) to avoid data conversion in comparison which will tremendously slow down the query. In our case we do not have information about tables structures and fields type, thus we give this rule as general recommendation only.
- Start with the inner join as it will limit the number of returned records, however this kind of optimization should be done by MySQL optimizer.
- If possible use inner join, instead of outer join (in our case left join) as outer join limits Query optimization possibilities. Unfortunately this rule cannot be applied as it will change the result of the query and will give wrong/incomplete result.
